A collection of my addons/scripts
==========
Feel free to download or view my addons. I'd appreciate any recommendations for improvements.

ULX_GrabScreen: Adds an in-game command allowing users to receive a low-quality screenshot from the target, showing exactly what they see inside their GMod window (including the steam overlay) at any given moment. Useful for catching hackers in the act. You can also save the image locally, to then upload as evidence for ban requests.

ULX_Murder: A set of ULX commands for usage specifically with the Murder gamemode
- !slaynr - Slay the target at the beggining of the round for as many rounds as you specify them. Automatically bans them if they leave with active autoslays. Prevents them from spawning as the Murderer to stop rounds being cut short. Additional configuration in file. You can remove all active slays if the player is on the server using !unslaynr
- !givemagnum - Give the target a magnum revolver (cannot give to the Murderer)
- !respawn - Respawns the target
- !mapnr - Changes the map at the beginning of the next round, including notifications when it is set and at the end of the round. Can be removed at any time using !unmapnr.
