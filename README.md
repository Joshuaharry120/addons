Feel free to download or view my addons. I'd appreciate any recommendations for improvements.

ULX_GrabScreen: Adds an in-game command allowing users to receive a low-quality screenshot from the target, showing exactly what they see inside their window at any given moment. Useful for catching hackers in the act. You can also save the image locally, to then upload as evidence requesting a ban.
