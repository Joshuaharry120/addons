A collection of my addons/scripts
==========
Feel free to download or view my addons. I'd appreciate any recommendations for improvements.

ULX_GrabScreen: Adds an in-game command allowing users to receive a low-quality screenshot from the target, showing exactly what they see inside their window at any given moment. Useful for catching hackers in the act. You can also save the image locally, to then upload as evidence requesting a ban.

ULX_Murder: A set of ULX commands for usage specifically with the Murder gamemode
- !slaynr - Slay the target at the beggining of the next round. Automatically bans them if they leave with active autoslays. Prevents them from spawning as the Murderer to stop rounds being cut short. Additional configuration in file.
- !givemagnum - Give the target a magnum revolver (cannot give to the Murderer)
- !respawn - Respawn the target (TODO: Prevent spectators from being respawned to prevent naming issues + chat notification)
